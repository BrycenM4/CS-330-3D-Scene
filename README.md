# CS-330-3D-Scene

**How do I approach designing software?**

Thoughout this project, I've learned how to visualize a project before I actually create it. This helped me come up with more ideas and methods I can use to eventually create a better end product. For this project, I tried to follow my reference image pretty closely, which wasn't too difficult because the shapes I used weren't that advanced, so I think that made the whole process a little bit easier overall. The tactics I used while developing this project could be used in my future career as a software developer, as they will allow me to create more advanced graphic/visualization projects when it comes to potential UI work that I'll be doing in the future.

**How do I approach developing programs?**

For this project specifically, I really had to try and visualize what I wanted the scene to look like, or else it was hard for me to come up with ideas on what I wanted to do. This was my first time every doing 3D work, so that alone was a challenge, but it was also one of the first projects I've done that uses visuals, so I'm still very new to all of it. Luckily, we went through interations throughout this course, which I think helped a lot because we broke the project up into different steps, such as textures, lighting, positioning, etc. This helped the development process go smoother.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

Learning more about graphics and visualizations can help me in my future career by giving me the tools needed to succeed in UI and visualiztion projects. I plan to be a software engineer in the future, so having this understanding of texturing, lighting, and positioning, will help immensely with creating professional UI and graphic implementations.
